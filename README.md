# 🐍 Python Learning Repository

Welcome to my personal **Python learning repository**, where I document my progress in solving algorithmic and programming challenges.
This repo serves both as a **learning log** and a **collection of solutions** to various tasks from online platforms and structured training programs.

## 📂 Repository Structure

### **1. 🧩 Leetcode/**

This folder contains my solutions to selected **LeetCode** problems.
Each file or subfolder corresponds to a specific problem, often including:

* The problem statement or link
* My Python solution
* Time and space complexity analysis
* Notes on alternative approaches

Example structure:

```
Leetcode/
├── 001_two_sum.py
├── 021_merge_two_sorted_lists.py
├── 070_climbing_stairs.py
└── README.md
```

### **2. 🚀 Yandex Algo 6.0/**

This folder contains materials and solutions from **Yandex Training on Algorithms 6.0**.
It includes both **problem descriptions** and **implemented solutions**, covering topics such as:

* Sorting and searching
* Data structures (stacks, queues, heaps)
* Graphs and dynamic programming
* Greedy and combinatorial algorithms

Example structure:

```
Yandex Algo 6.0/
├── 01_introduction/
│   ├── task_A.py
|   ├── task_A_readme.md
│   └── task_B.py
├── 02_sorting/
│   ├── quick_sort.py
│   └── merge_sort.py
└── README.md
```

## 💡 Purpose of the Repository

This repository is intended to:

* Track my progress in Python and algorithmic problem solving.
* Serve as a **reference base** for future interview preparation.
* Improve my **coding style, performance awareness, and documentation skills**.
* Reflect my growth through consistent practice and structured learning.

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Python 3.11+**
* Standard libraries: `itertools`, `collections`, `heapq`, `math`, `bisect`, etc.
* Occasionally: `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib` for analysis or visualization.

---

## 📈 Future Plans

* Add unit tests for selected solutions.
* Create Jupyter notebooks explaining complex problems step by step.
* Include visual explanations (e.g., recursion trees, DP tables).
* Expand with **Codeforces**, **AtCoder**, and **Kaggle** problem sets.
